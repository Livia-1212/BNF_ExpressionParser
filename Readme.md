# Expression Parser

A recursive descent parser and evaluator for arithmetic expressions written in Java. This parser follows a customized BNF grammar where `+` and `-` have higher precedence than `*` and `/`, reversing typical mathematical precedence.

## üìã BNF Grammar

```bnf
<expression> ::= <factor> * <expression>
              |  <factor> / <expression>
              |  <factor>

<factor>     ::= <term> + <factor>
              |  <term> - <factor>
              |  <term>

<term>       ::= { <expression> }
              |  <literal>

<literal>    ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 
```




## Features
Parses and evaluates numeric expressions

Supports {} for nested expressions

Correctly applies reversed operator precedence

Constructs an expression tree

Outputs the tree structure in DOT format (Graphviz compatible)

Supports float evaluation for accurate results


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    javac src/ExpressionParser.java
    ```
2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java -cp src ExpressionParser
    ```
3. Input an expression when prompted.
4. Visualization of the expression tree:\
   This project generates a Graphviz Dot file named `tree.dot` in the current directory. \
   You can visualize it using Graphviz tools by converting the expression tree to an image:
    ```bash
    dot -Tpng tree.dot -o tree.png
    ```
5.open tree.png


## üß™ Example
```bash
Input: 4/2/2+8*2*3+1
Expression Tree: ((4.0 / 2.0) / 2.0 + 8.0) * (2.0 * (3.0 + 1.0))
Evaluated Result: 1.6
DOT file written to tree.dot
```
